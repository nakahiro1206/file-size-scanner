# file-size-scanner

This bash script would be helpful when you need to identify huge files that consume your storage.

It recursively scans ```~/``` directory and identifies the top 3 children directory with large files.

Then it will output file paths and sizes in descending order by scanning each of the 3 directories again.

## Next Step(To be Taken)

Allow GUI operations with a front-end framework like Next.js.
